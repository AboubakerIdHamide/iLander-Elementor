# iLander
The iLander WordPress Landing Page is a website template built using Elementor, a popular drag-and-drop page builder plugin for WordPress. This template was created as part of a YouTube crash course where I learned how to use Elementor by building the iLander landing page. It provided me with hands-on experience in designing and customizing websites using the Elementor interface. Throughout the course, I gained valuable knowledge about creating responsive layouts, adding animations, and integrating various widgets and plugins. I'm excited to apply these skills to future web development projects and continue expanding my proficiency with Elementor and WordPress.
